# SimCore
A C++ Simulation Core

## Compiling
Run cmake (libraries will be installed automatically) and compile

Run cmake with -DSIMCORE_ENABLE_TESTING=0 or set SIMCORE_ENABLE_TESTING=0 in cmake file to disable testing

## Usage
See tests to understand how the framework works. I will add a description soon. Probably.
